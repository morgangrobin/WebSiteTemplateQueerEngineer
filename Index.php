					<h1>Welcome!</h1>
  						
   							<p>Queer Engineer is an EUS club at McGill University that strives to provide a safe and
						welcoming environment for gender and sexual minorities, within both
						the Faculty of Engineering and McGill as whole.  We welcome all gay,
						lesbian, bisexual, asexual, trans*, queer and allied students, and students
						with non-normative sexual and/or gender identities outside of those
						labels.  As a primarily social organization, we hold weekly Safe Space
						Hangouts and various fun events throughout the year, such as wine and
						cheese gatherings and outings to the Village.</p>
